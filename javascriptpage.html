      <h3>General Notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A Variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code </li>
        <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically this data is related in some
          way</li>
        <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning the first item has an index of 0 and each following item's
          index is +1</li>
        <li>"For Loops" use the predictable index pattern to perform a task on all of the items within an array by
          allowing a single code block to be excecuted repeatedly</li>
        <li>A "For Loop" contains the following 3 statements:
          <ol>
            <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning
              of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0
              (because the first index of an array is always 0),</li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length
              of the array, the loop will keep running.
              This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array
              property on our shapes array to express that condition</li>
            <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a
              predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time.
              The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
