# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## A simple site consisting of numerous pages containing information regarding different coding languages and webpage creation methodologies. 


- The motivation behind this project was a need to have quick access to clearly presented information regarding coding languages and methodologies.
- In creating this webpage I was able to learn and practice coding methods and farmiliarise myself with best practices whilst giving myself a useful reference for any future projects
- Having this webpage solves issues in future, should I forget how to do something or get lost within code, I'll be able to easily remind myself of what to do. 
- Throughout this project I have learned the basics of coding HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript; I've also learned about Gitflow, Bash Commands and Markdown syntax.
