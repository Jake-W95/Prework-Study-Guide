          <h3 class="header">Frontend Only Application</h3> This can range from pure static
          html/css/js or a more elaborate single page application built with React,
          Svelte, Vue, Angular, or with Native Web Components. These sites are usually
          deployed using static servers which is essentially what services like Vercel
          and Netlify provide or with traditionals hosts where you upload files to some
          web server space that are statically served. When using a framework like React
          and friends, these services connect your deployment to your project's Github
          then anytime you update GitHub it runs your project's build command and serves
          the output statically.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="header">Full-Stack Applications</h3 > These are applications where you create a
          more complex server (not static) that does more advanced data manipulation
          and then uses that data with a template engine (ejs, blade, erb, plush, pug)
          to generate static HTML from the server which is then sent to the client.
          This generally needs more robust deployment services so either requires you
          to set up your own server using a VPS from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Linode,
          Digital Ocean, or other cloud services or using a service like Heroku which
          simplifies many of the setup steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="header">Backend and Frontend Applications</h3> Nowadays applications are so
          complex they are really many applications or "Micro Services" handling
          dedicated parts of the application. You may have one backend application
          that only handles user authentication while other applications then handle
          different products (think of Google's vast array of services).
          All these backend microservices will be deployed like a full-stack application
          using a service like Heroku while the frontend will be built as a separate
          application deployed by a service like Heroku. The frontend application will
          make requests to all the API's these microservices deliver. This makes the
          architecture more modular and reusable for different client-side platforms
          (desktop, mobile, devices).
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="header">Serverless</h3> This takes microservices to the next level where you
          just don't have backend applications at all. Instead, all your APIs are
          built as several cloud functions that run on-demand which then have URLs
          for your frontend to call them. Since you don't have to have a persistent
          backend server running 24/7 and with the much lower-cost of static hosting
          for the frontend, taking a serverless approach can be very affordable even
          at large scales. AWS, Azure, and Google all offer cloud function platforms
          and Netlify offers a nice abstraction of Amazon's Cloud Functions and Firebase
          offers a nice abstraction over Google's Cloud functions service.
