        <li>A Variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code </li>
        <li>An Array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data, typically this data is related in some way</li>
        <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning the first item has an index of 0 and each following item's index is +1</li>
        <li>"For Loops" use the predictable index pattern to perform a task on all of the items within an array by allowing a single code block to be excecuted repeatedly</li>
        <li>A "For Loop" contains the following 3 statements: 
          <ol>
            <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 
              (because the first index of an array is always 0),</li>
            <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running.
              This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition</li>
            <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time.
              The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1</li>

    <section class="card" id="app-architecture-types">
      <h2>Application Architecture Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><h3>Frontend Only Application</h3> This can range from pure static 
          html/css/js or a more elaborate single page application built with React,
          Svelte, Vue, Angular, or with Native Web Components. These sites are usually 
          deployed using static servers which is essentially what services like Vercel 
          and Netlify provide or with traditionals hosts where you upload files to some 
          web server space that are statically served. When using a framework like React 
          and friends, these services connect your deployment to your project's Github 
          then anytime you update GitHub it runs your project's build command and serves 
          the output statically.</li>
        <li><h3>Full-Stack Applications</h3> These are applications where you create a 
          more complex server (not static) that does more advanced data manipulation 
          and then uses that data with a template engine (ejs, blade, erb, plush, pug) 
          to generate static HTML from the server which is then sent to the client. 
          This generally needs more robust deployment services so either requires you 
          to set up your own server using a VPS from Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Linode, 
          Digital Ocean, or other cloud services or using a service like Heroku which 
          simplifies many of the setup steps.</li>
        <li><h3>Backend and Frontend Applications</h3> Nowadays applications are so 
          complex they are really many applications or "Micro Services" handling 
          dedicated parts of the application. You may have one backend application 
          that only handles user authentication while other applications then handle 
          different products (think of Google's vast array of services). 
          All these backend microservices will be deployed like a full-stack application 
          using a service like Heroku while the frontend will be built as a separate 
          application deployed by a service like Heroku. The frontend application will 
          make requests to all the API's these microservices deliver. This makes the 
          architecture more modular and reusable for different client-side platforms 
          (desktop, mobile, devices).</li>  
        <li><h3>Serverless</h3> This takes microservices to the next level where you 
          just don't have backend applications at all. Instead, all your APIs are 
          built as several cloud functions that run on-demand which then have URLs 
          for your frontend to call them. Since you don't have to have a persistent 
          backend server running 24/7 and with the much lower-cost of static hosting 
          for the frontend, taking a serverless approach can be very affordable even 
          at large scales. AWS, Azure, and Google all offer cloud function platforms 
          and Netlify offers a nice abstraction of Amazon's Cloud Functions and Firebase 
          offers a nice abstraction over Google's Cloud functions service.</li>
